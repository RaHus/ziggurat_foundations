Changelog
=========

2015-04-17
----------
* Release: 0.5
* Now uses detailed permissions
* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE API CHANGES
    * ResourceMixin.users_for_perm() accepts additional parameters group_ids, and user_ids
      to limit the amount of results if needed
    * User.permissions, Resource.perms_for_user, Resource.direct_perms_for_user,
      Resource.group_perms_for_user, Resource.users_for_perm_detailed, Resource.users_for_perm
      now return list of detailed PermissionTuple's instead simple [id, perm_name] pairs
      this will break your application
      You can use ziggurat_foundations.utils.permission_to_04_acls() to convert
      the new tuples to pre 0.5 format


2015-02-18
----------
* Release: 0.4.3

2014-08-25
----------
* Second Alpha Release 0.4
* Move to paginate from webhelpers.paginate
* Users can now log in via username or email address
* Python 3 compatibale after moving away from webhelpers.paginate


2012-11-28
----------
* First Alpha Release 0.3 - This release should have a fairly stable API
* Hundreds of small and big changes - based on all great feedback we are now 
  using surrogate pkeys instead of natural pkeys for most models. 
  As result of this few methods started accepting id's instead usernames, 
  so consider yourself warned that this release might be bw. incompatible a bit 
  with your application
* At this point all tests should pass on mysql, postgresql, sqlite

.. hint::
    What "previous revision ID" means? 
    If you are updating the package that never was stamped with 
    alembic you may need to stamp the database manually with following revision id, 
    from this point onwards you will be able to update schemas automaticly.
    Alembic 0.3.3+ (or current trunk for 2012-05-27) is required for this to function properly
